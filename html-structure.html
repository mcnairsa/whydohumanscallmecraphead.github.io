<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 1/14 Preparing for HTML
    The document type declaration or doctype tells the browser what kind of document we are presenting and what version i.e what standards to use -->
<!-- See here:
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/why-is-doctype-uppercase-but-html-lower/471818 
for an explanation of the use of u.c. and l.c. in the document type declaration -->

<!-- 2/14 The <html> tag
    Anything between <html> and </html> will be interpreted by the browser as html and 'rendered' i.e. displayed in a browser window -->
<html>
<!-- 3/14 The Head
    Contains metadata or information about the page but not any page content -->    
    <head> 
        <title>Another Page About HTML Pages</title> 
<!-- 4/14 The title & 5/14 Where Does the Title Appear?
    The title appears in the browser tab
    see https://content.codecademy.com/courses/updated_images/htmlcss1-diagram__sitetitle_Updated_1.svg -->
    </head>
    <body>
<!-- 6/14 Linking to Other Web Pages
    Links put the HT in html
    We make links with an anchor element <a> ... </a> 
    the href in an anchor element identifies the path or address of the file linked to
    This can be the URL of a resource on the internet or a local file, i.e. a file on the same computer as the current page.
    For example: -->
    <h1 id="resources">Resources for learning HTML</h1>
    <p>Learn more about building web pages
        <ul>    
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> Another great place to learn to code. (Use the browser back button to get back to the main page.)</a></li>
<!-- 7/14 Opening Links in a New Window
    use the target attribute -->
            <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">And here's another option but this will open in a new window (or tab depending you your browser's settings).</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"> HTML elements reference in Mozilla documentation </a></li>
        </ul>    
        </p>
<!-- 8/14 Linking to Relative Page
    A relative path is relative to the current file; e.g.:
    ./index.htm (where './' means that the resource is in the same directory [folder] as the current page.)
    An absolute path contins the full details of how to access the required document, either a URL or a path starting with the root of the computer; e.g.:
    https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html -->    
<!-- 9/14 Linking at Will 
    Other resources such images can be made into links by embedding, e.g. an img element into the anchor element.
    -->    
<!-- 1-/14 Linking to Same Page 
    We can jump around in the current page by using an id on our page as the target for an anchor element. 
    -->
    <a href="#resources">Here are some (internal) links to more places to learn about building web pages.</a>
<!-- 11/14 Whitespace 
    ... in the html source file is ignored by the browser when rendering the document. -->
<!-- 12/14 Indentation
    Two spaces is the current (as or 20-12-2022) standard recommended by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
    Note: this file uses tabs instead, Bad Sam!
