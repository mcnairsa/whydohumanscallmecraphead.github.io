		<h3 id="hosting">Hosting is...</h3>
		<p> ...	providing a home for your killer app. If you want the world to know about your killer app but don't want to give the world access your computer (and you really <em>don't</em> want to do that) then you need to find a home for it with a 'hosting provider'. There are different types of hosting service.
			<ul>
				<li><em>Shared</em> hosting: like sharing a flat ['appartment'] which is OK till your flatmate has a bunch of friends round and they're up partying all night when you have work the next day. Other users can gobble up resources on the host machine or  <em>server</em>. Your users' experience of your site will suffer as a result.</li>
				<li><em>Dedicated</em> hosting: you have no flatmates to worry about but you pay all the rent and bills. Generally more expensive but you have more contol over the server.</li>
				<li><em>Cloud</em> hosting: more like a hotel or renting a room through AirBnB: you pick what space you need and what facilities you need. this can vary from a room with a bed and you bring your own bed linen to a fully serviced room where you can just turn up and get your head down. There are different models of cloud computing including:
				  <ul>
					<li><em>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</em>: you get the barebones of the hardware but have control over things like what o/s and dbms it runs.</li>
					<li><em>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</em>: the cloud provider takes responsibility for configuration and provides everything you need to run your application.</li>
					<li><em>Function as a Service (FaaS)</em>: breaks the application down into its separate function and runs them in response to events. FaaS is itself a form of <em>serverless</em> computing.</li>
				  </ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
            <ul><h3>Suggestions/Recommendations:</h3>
				<li><em>GitHub Pages:</em> works well for static sites</li>
				<li><em>Heroku:</em> a PaaS more suited to full-stack applications great for proof-of concept or quick demos; gets expensive if trying to run anything production ready.</li>
				<li><em>Digital Ocean:</em> is a cloud provider. Their range of <em>virtual private server (VPS)</em> options gives you the choice of pre-built solutions including bloging and e-commerce or you can install your own stack and applications from thro/s upwards. </li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="domains">A Domain is ...</h3>
		<p> ... the name for a location on the internet.
			Computers use numbers in the form of ip (=<em>I</em>nternet <em>P</em>rotocol) address such as 12.34.56.78 to communicate over the internet. 'The Domain Name System (<strong>DNS</strong>) is the phonebook of the internet.' [cloudflare.com]
		    <ul>
				<li><em>DNS searches</em>: first the local cache is searched to see if the resource is already known. If not then a chain of searches takes place that ultimately results in an ip address being returned to the application on your computer that wants to communicate over the 'net.</li>
                <li><em>Structure of a domain</em> your domain consists of a name you choose like the name of your town, business or blog (the bit before the DOT) plus <strong>top level domains</strong> (TLDs) such as .com or .org.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3 id="ghp">GitHub Pages ...</h3>
			<p> ...	is a hosting service available to anyone with a GitHub account. It is ideal for any kind of static site such a project documentation or a simple blog. <br>
				It can be used to host html and css and compiled ReactJS apps. Pages can also be written in Markdown. <br>
				Pages can be uploaded by git or by drag and drop from your local file browser in to the GHP page in your [web]browser.
